# my-flask-app
Based on the official flask tutorial

## Running the App
### Running the Development Server


From a terminal at the root directory run:

    source tesing/set_flaskr_env.sh

This directs all flask commands from this terminal towards the flaskr app.
Available commands are:

    flask run  # starts the development server, blocks the terminal
    flask init-db  # initializes/resets the SQLite database
